### Minor Changes

- f67e304: fix component styles not loading in apps and Storybook

  `defineTsdownLibrary` now re-links every extracted stylesheet to the JS module that owns it via a `writeBundle` pass (opt out with `cssBundle: false`). Under the tsdown/Rolldown build, co-located `*.module.scss` / `*.scss` imports were extracted to standalone `.css` assets but their side-effect imports were dropped from the JS (left as `/* empty css */`), so importing a component shipped its markup without its styles. Each `X.css` is now imported from its CSS-Module class map (`X.module.js`) — or, for the Vue build, from the component chunk (`X.vue_vue_type_style_*.css` → `X.js`) — so importing a single component (or the package barrel) automatically loads exactly its styles again, matching the historical Vite library build.

- f67e304: migrate library builds to tsdown

  Every library workspace across `packages/`, `vite-plugins/`, `configs/`, `workers/`, and the MCP servers now builds
  with [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev) (Rolldown/Oxc)
  instead of `tsc` / `vite build`. A new shared `@mission-platform/tsdown-config`
  package exposes the generic `defineTsdownLibrary` / `defineTsdownVueLibrary`
  helpers, and `@mission-platform/vite-plugin-forge` now additionally exports tsdown-compatible forge helpers
  (`defineTsdownForgeHooks(All)`,
  `defineTsdownForgeComponents(All)`, `defineTsdownForgeStoryblok(All)`) plus the Rolldown stage-2 adapters needed to
  reproduce the write-once multi-framework output under tsdown.

  This is a build-tooling change only: every package's public `exports`, `dist`
  layout, `types`, and framework auto-resolution (`mp:*` conditions) are unchanged, so consumers are unaffected. The
  `@mission-platform/forms` `web-components`
  target remains a hybrid Vite step, and `@mission-platform/hunspell` keeps its
  `build:wasm` toolchain.

### Patch Changes

- bd88e5e: rename the component library prefix from `Base` to `Forge`

  BREAKING CHANGE: every exported component symbol and its folder/file and CSS class name is renamed from `Base*`/`base-*` to `Forge*`/`forge-*` (e.g. `BaseButton` → `ForgeButton`), and previously-unprefixed components (`HideAt`, `ShowAt`, `BreakpointDebug`) and every icon (`IconStar` → `ForgeIconStar`) now carry the `Forge` prefix. Consumers must update all imports and template usages accordingly.

- b23115e: add a workspace-local .prettierignore so build output is excluded from format checks
